## 🧬 About the Book

This book guides readers through using LLMs in real-world life sciences and healthcare applications. Beginning with foundational AI concepts, the book progresses toward building intelligent, multi-agent, and multimodal apps using LangChain and its ecosystem. With complete runnable notebooks, each chapter provides hands-on code, annotated examples, and datasets to learn from.
