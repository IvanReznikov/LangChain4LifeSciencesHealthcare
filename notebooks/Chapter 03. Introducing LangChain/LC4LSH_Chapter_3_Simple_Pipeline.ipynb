Bawendi, Louis \\nE. Brus, and Aleksey I. Yekimov the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023, for the discovery and \\nsynthesis of quantum dots.\\nIntroduction \\nThis year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognizes the discovery and synthesis of nanometre-sized \\nsemiconductor crystals, the properties of which are determined by quantum size effects. Referred \\nto as quantum dots, such nanoparticles are so small that their physical size determines the \\nquantum mechanical states of the material’s charge carriers. \\nQu\\nantum dots constitute a new class of materials \\nthat is neither molecular nor bulk. They have the \\nsame structure and atomic composition as bulk \\nmaterials, but their properties can be tuned using \\na single parameter, the particle’s size. For \\nexample, the optical absorption and emission of \\nCdSe quantum dots can be tuned across nearly \\nthe entire visible  range of the optical spectrum . \\nThis is possible because the energy bandgap  of \\nCdSe quantum dots varies between 1.8 eV (its \\nbulk value) to 3 eV (in the smallest quantum dots, \\nsee Fig. 1) . Other material properties that are \\ntuneable by quantum dot size include redox \\npotentials\\n1, melting temperature 2, and solid-\\nsolid phase transitions,3 to name just a few. \\nThe discovery of quantum dots, and the ability to synthesize such materials with high accuracy \\nbut relatively simple chemical methods, was an important step in the development of nanoscience \\nand nanotechnology. The core principle of nanoscience is that, at the scale of nanometres , \\nmaterials and particles attain new, size -dependent properties that can be harnessed and \\ncontrolled for novel applications . The tools of chemistry are an indispensable enabler of \\nnanotechnology, with applications in areas as diverse as biotechnology, catalysis, sensing, medical \\ndiagnostics, electronics, photonics, and quantum technology. \\nFig. 1.

The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.\n","Summary::\n","The feasibility of doxorubicin (Dox) detection in plasma and blood using a luminescence turn-off nanosensor based on alloyed CdZnSeS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) is demonstrated. The QD luminescence quenching in the presence of Dox was carefully examined. Optimal assay conditions were selected, including plasma dilution and QD concentration. The calculated limit of detection value was 0.02 µg/mL. Time-resolved QD luminescence quenching and absorption measurements allowed us to determine that the quenching process occurs via a combined mechanism. At low Dox concentrations, the dynamic quenching is predominant, while at Dox concentrations above 2.5 μM, the contribution of static quenching increases drastically. Dox detection in whole human blood was performed and compared with other methods for the drug detection in blood. The results of the method are comparable with those of the high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible detection.\n","\n","Published: 2025-05-24\n","Title: Highly sensitive CdSe/ZnS quantum dots immunosensor via DNA tetrahedra nanostructure-assembled with multiple hybridization chain reaction.\n","Copyright Information: Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

This parameter not only influences the efficiency of photon energy absorption but also defines the pn junction area, thereby affecting the magnitude of the dark current. Furthermore, it significantly impacts the manufacturability of via-hole etching and formation processes. This paper investigated the photonic crystal resonances and coherent perfect absorption (CPA) effect of a thin MCT layer in HDVIP by using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b and optimized the structure of the loop-hole photodiode device. The CPA, which is formed by this structure, achieves high absorption of illumination in a very thin MCT film. It is demonstrated that an absorption rate of infrared radiation of more than 95% with a wavelength during the 8 µm-10 µm range can be achieved in HgCdTe (x = 0.225) with a thickness of only 1.5 µm-3 µm. The benefit of thinner MCT film is that it decreases the dark current of pn junction and reduces the technical difficulty of etching and metallization of the loop-hole photodiode.\n","\n","Published: 2025-07-01\n","Title: Quantitative assessment of ohmic-type CdTe sensor response in a photon-counting X-ray imaging detector under continuous 12-49 keV irradiations.\n","Copyright Information: open access.\n","Summary::\n","['-1', '-1']\n","For several years, photon-counting X-ray imaging detectors with cadmium telluride (CdTe) sensors have been used in high-energy synchrotron experiments.

It is worth noting that  represents the first polyoxotungstate simultaneously incorporating S and Te heteroatoms in the polyoxometalate family. Moreover, its application in photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was explored by sonicating  into nanosized crystals (). Subsequently, a Au//PbS composite material comprising , lead sulfide (PbS) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was prepared, which was utilized to construct a PEC sensor for detecting hydrogen peroxide with a detection limit of 2.331 μM and the detection range from 5 × 10 to 5 × 10 M.
